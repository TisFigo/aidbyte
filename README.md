## ‚ö° Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or yarn
* Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-github-username/aidbyte-website.git](https://github.com/your-github-username/aidbyte-website.git)
    cd aidbyte-website
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    If using Node.js for a build process or server:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
    If it's a purely static site, this step might not be necessary, or only for dev tools.

### Running Locally

1.  **Start the development server:**
    If using a Node.js-based frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Next.js):
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    If it's a static site without a complex build step, you might just need a simple local server:
    ```bash
    # For a simple Python HTTP server (if Python is installed):
    python -m http.server 8000
    # Or use a Node.js package like 'serve':
    # npm install -g serve
    # serve -s build
    ```
2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port your server is running on, often displayed in the terminal).
